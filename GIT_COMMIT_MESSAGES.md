## Commit 1: Add Windows compatibility fixes for LAMMPS compilation

```
Add Windows compatibility fixes for LAMMPS 7Aug2019 + EChemDID

This commit adds critical Windows-specific memory allocation fixes required
to compile and run LAMMPS on Windows 11 with MSYS2 MinGW64.

Changes:
- Fixed warnings_results/my_pool_chunk.h: Replace posix_memalign with _aligned_malloc for Windows
- Fixed warnings_results/my_page.h: Replace posix_memalign with _aligned_malloc for Windows
- Fixed warnings_results/memory.cpp: Add Windows support for smalloc/srealloc/sfree functions
- Fixed warnings_results/Makefile.mingw64_mpi: Use KISS FFT and add psapi library

Key fixes:
1. Memory allocation: Use _aligned_malloc instead of posix_memalign on Windows
2. Memory deallocation: Use _aligned_free instead of free for aligned memory
3. Memory reallocation: Use _aligned_realloc for consistency
4. Proper cleanup in destructors to prevent heap corruption (0xc0000374)

Technical details:
- Windows MinGW64 lacks POSIX posix_memalign function
- Memory allocated with _aligned_malloc MUST be freed with _aligned_free
- Mixing allocation methods causes heap corruption, especially in MPI mode
- Added conditional compilation guards: #if defined(_WIN32) || defined(_WIN64)

Testing:
- Single process: lmp_mingw64_mpi.exe runs successfully
- MPI mode: mpiexec -n 2/4 lmp_mingw64_mpi.exe works without heap errors
- All LAMMPS examples complete successfully

Files modified:
- warnings_results/my_pool_chunk.h
- warnings_results/my_page.h  
- warnings_results/memory.cpp
- warnings_results/Makefile.mingw64_mpi

System tested: Windows 11, GCC 15.2.0 (MinGW-w64), MS-MPI 10.1.1
```

## Commit 2: Update setup guide with Windows compatibility instructions

```
Update ASUS_LAMMPS_Setup_Guide.md with complete Windows fixes

Comprehensive update to setup guide based on successful ASUS build:

Major changes:
- Added Phase 5.7: Apply Windows Compatibility Fixes (detailed source code modifications)
- Updated executable name throughout: lmp_mpi → lmp_mingw64_mpi.exe
- Removed alias creation instructions (using direct executable name)
- Added explicit MSYS2 MinGW64 requirement warnings
- Removed old troubleshooting section (replaced with proactive fixes)

Phase 5.7 additions:
- Complete source code fixes for my_pool_chunk.h (allocate function + destructor)
- Complete source code fixes for my_page.h (allocate + destructor + init)
- Complete source code fixes for memory.cpp (smalloc + srealloc + sfree)
- Step-by-step instructions with exact code replacements
- Explanatory comments for each Windows-specific modification

Testing updates:
- Phase 7.2: Updated serial execution examples with expected output
- Phase 7.3: Added MPI testing with success indicators
- Added heap corruption error code (0xc0000374) to success criteria
- Updated all command examples to use lmp_mingw64_mpi.exe

Documentation improvements:
- Emphasized MSYS2 MinGW64 requirement (NOT Git Bash)
- Added critical notes about memory allocation on Windows
- Clarified that Windows fixes are mandatory, not optional
- Added expected compilation output examples

Files modified:
- ASUS_LAMMPS_Setup_Guide.md (comprehensive rewrite of Phases 5-7)

This guide now provides a complete, repeatable process for Windows builds.

## Commit 3: Add comprehensive Windows compatibility documentation

```
Add WINDOWS_COMPATIBILITY_SUMMARY.md with detailed technical reference

Created comprehensive technical documentation for Windows-specific LAMMPS fixes.

Document contents:
- Problem statement: Why Windows builds fail
- Root causes: posix_memalign absence, memory free mismatch, realloc issues
- Complete source code modifications for all 3 files
- Build process and prerequisites
- Testing procedures (single + MPI)
- Key lessons learned
- Debugging tips for heap corruption
- Makefile configuration details
- Success criteria checklist

Technical depth:
- Explains heap corruption error 0xc0000374
- Details memory allocation API differences (POSIX vs Windows)
- Documents object lifecycle impact on MPI vs single process
- Provides debugging commands and search patterns
- Links to Microsoft documentation for aligned memory functions

Purpose:
- Serves as quick reference for future builds
- Explains the "why" behind each fix
- Helps troubleshoot if issues recur
- Documents version-specific information

Files added:
- WINDOWS_COMPATIBILITY_SUMMARY.md

This complements the step-by-step setup guide with technical background.

## Commit 4: Add build artifacts and test results

```
Add compilation outputs and test results from successful ASUS build

This commit adds reference files from the successful Windows build for
documentation and troubleshooting purposes.

Files included:
- build_output.txt: Complete successful compilation log
- gdb_output.txt: Debugger session showing heap corruption diagnosis
- speed_test_melt.txt: Performance test results (optional, if created)
- 7_2.txt, 7_3.txt: Testing session outputs

These files demonstrate:
- What a successful build looks like
- How heap corruption was diagnosed with gdb
- Progression from errors to successful execution
- Performance characteristics on Windows

Not included in repository:
- Large error logs from failed attempts (kept locally for reference)
- Source tarballs (available from official LAMMPS site)
- Compiled binaries (platform-specific)

Files added:
- warnings_results/build_output.txt
- warnings_results/gdb_output.txt
- warnings_results/7_2.txt
- warnings_results/7_3.txt
```

Created repository README with project overview, quick start, and
detailed navigation guide.

README sections:
- Project description and goals
- System requirements
- Quick start guide (essential steps)
- Detailed documentation links
- Repository structure
- Key files and their purposes
- Troubleshooting quick reference
- Contributing guidelines
- License information

Key features:
- Links to main setup guide
- Links to technical compatibility doc
- Highlights critical Windows-specific requirements
